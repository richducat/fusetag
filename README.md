# Fusetag UI Preview

This project is a Next.js app showcasing a simplified, Google-inspired connection hub UI.

## Getting a live preview
1. Install dependencies (already vendored via `package-lock.json`):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server on an externally reachable host:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

For a production-like preview, build then start:
```bash
npm run preview
```
